This folder contains synthetic datasets with implanted ranked tiles. Numeric data was generated first, then it was converted to rank data. The noise level is controlled by the parameter p, which is described in our "ranked tiling" paper [1].

5bic_num.txt : p = 0.1
5bic_num_2.txt: p = 0.15
5bic_num_3.txt: p = 0.20
5bic_num_4.txt: p = 0.25
5bic_num_5.txt: p = 0.30
5bic_num_6.txt: p = 0.35
5bic_num_7.txt: p = 0.40
